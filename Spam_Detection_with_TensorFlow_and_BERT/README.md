# Spam Detection with TensorFlow and BERT

## Project Overview
This project aims to accurately classify text messages as spam or ham (non-spam) using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub, and the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, we developed a sophisticated deep learning model that understands the nuances of textual data, enabling precise spam detection.

## Key Features
- **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Utilizes TensorFlow and BERT for feature extraction, enhancing the model's text understanding.
- **High Precision and Recall**: Achieves a precision of 0.96 and a recall of 0.95 in spam detection, indicating high model reliability.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics**: Demonstrated model performance with an accuracy and F1-score of 0.95, showcasing its robustness across various message types.

## Technologies Used
- TensorFlow & TensorFlow Hub
- BERT for NLP
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for model evaluation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

## Model Performance
The table below presents the detailed performance metrics of the model:

| Metric     | Score |
|------------|-------|
| Precision  | 0.96  |
| Recall     | 0.95  |
| F1-Score   | 0.95  |
| Accuracy   | 0.95  |

These metrics were obtained on a balanced dataset, ensuring the model's effectiveness across different message classifications.
